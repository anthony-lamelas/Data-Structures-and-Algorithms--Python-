# Data Structures and Algorithms – NYU

This repository contains code and assignments completed for my **Data Structures and Algorithms** course at **NYU Tandon School of Engineering**.

The course focuses on implementing and analyzing fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python and C++.

## Topics Covered:
- Arrays and Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees (Binary, AVL, etc.)  
- Hash Tables  
- Graphs and Traversals  
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
- Recursion and Divide & Conquer  
- Big-O Analysis

## Work Includes:
- Coding assignments  
- Problem sets  
- Practice problems for technical interviews  
- Time and space complexity analysis
